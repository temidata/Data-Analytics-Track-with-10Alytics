# Data-Analytics-Track-with-10Alytics Week 1
This repository entails the lessons covered during the course of learning Data Analytics with 10Alytics E-learning Platform.

# Class 1: Data Analytics 
In the class, I learnt about the introduction of Data Analytics as a devotion to realizing actionable insights that can be instantly applicable inoder to drive business decisions.

# Types of Data Analytics 
1). Discriptive Analytics:- Discriptive analytics discribes and answers the question "What happened". Examples are Sandine Sales Dashboard, Monthly Revenue Report 2020.

2). Diagnostics Analytics:- Diagnostics analytics describes and answers the question "Why did it happen". It exposes the connections amongs data amd the trends within the data . Examples: Identifying with marketing sctovity increased sales, Indentifying the month sales where affected by the pandemic.

3). Predictive Analytics:- Predictive Analytics attempts to answer the question "what will happen next". This is a method of using quality data for forcasting. This method relies on statistic modelling and regression. Examples: Sales Forcasting.

4). Prescriptive Analytics:- Prescriptive analytics entails every other analysis with the application of AI and Machine Learning

# Problem Solving 
Learnt about problems and phases of problem in business, Business problem solving techniques,and how to document problem statements.

# Problem Solving in Business Understanding
Often times, the real problem is not knowing that there is a problem or not understanding the root cause of the problem. 
In other to fully have a clear picture of what the problem is the answer to the following questions could be vital in problem understanding.

Question 1: What is the problem?
What is the problem that needs to be solved? Include the root cause of the problem. 

• Question 2: Where is the problem?
Where is the problem observed? Mentioning the location and the specifics of it. Not neglecting the products or services in which the problem is seen.

• Question 3: Why is it important?
Explain the impacts of the problem. Describing the “Pain” associated with the problem and what is the effect of the problem?

• Question 4: What is the magnitude?
How often is the problem observed? Its possible by identifying trends during research, stating the trends. Commenting on the error rate and the frequency and magnitude of the problem.

# The 5 Ways as a Tool In Problem Solving By Suzuki

Sakichi Toyoda, the Japanese industrialist, inventor, and founder of Toyota Industries, developed the 5 Whys technique in the 1930s. The "go and see" philosophy. This means that its decision making is based on an in-depth understanding of what's happening on the shop floor, rather than on what someone in a boardroom thinks might be happening.

Define the problem > Why did this problem happen > Why did this problem happen >  Why did this problem happen >  Why did this problem happen > Why did this problem happen = Solution.


# A real life application of the 5 Why's 
                         
                                           Problem :  got arrested for overspeeding > 
                                            (why? 1) > Resp: late for work 
                                           > (why lateness to work ? 2) > woke up late 
                                           >(why waking up late ? 3) > Alarm clock didnt work
                                           >(why didn't it work? 4) > Dead Batteries
                                          > ( why having Dead Batteries ? 5) I forgot to replace them.
                                           
                 
According to Suzuki the root cause of the problem is the last point  Not replacing Dead Batteries. The solution will be to get an alarm clock or to use your mobile phone as an alarm clock.
  

# MECE and Issue Tree 
MECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. The best issue trees are mutually exclusive, meaning that there are no overlaps amongst the different smaller components. They are also collectively exhaustive, meaning that the components cover all potential root causes of the problem.

For instance, imagine your client has a profitability problem. Your issue true would be mutually exclusive by focusing on revenue and costs, as there are no overlaps between the two. The issue tree is also collectively exhaustive in that there are no other components that need to be added given that Profit = Revenue –Costs.

In otherwords solving the Profitability Issue (Profit) every bit of the revenue is solved and every bit of the cost is solved.
